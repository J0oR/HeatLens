      text: "Global temperatures have increased sharply in recent decades, accelerating at nearly three times the rate observed before 1980. This rapid warming is driven largely by human emissions of greenhouse gases. Since the Industrial Revolution, Earth‚Äôs average temperature has risen about 1¬∞C, with the Arctic warming even faster. These changes disrupt climate systems, causing more extreme weather, rising sea levels, melting ice, and loss of biodiversity. Rising temperatures threaten ecosystems, agriculture, water supplies, and human health worldwide. Understanding temperature trends is crucial for predicting future impacts and guiding climate action.",

Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture have raised CO‚ÇÇ levels by over 30%, reaching concentrations unseen in hundreds of thousands of years. CO‚ÇÇ is crucial because it traps heat in the atmosphere, driving global warming. This warming disrupts weather patterns, melts ice caps, raises sea levels, and threatens ecosystems and human societies worldwide. Elevated CO‚ÇÇ also affects ocean chemistry, causing acidification that harms marine life.

It comes from natural sources like wetlands, but over half now comes from human activities‚Äîlivestock, agriculture, landfills, and fossil fuels.Although methane breaks down faster than CO‚ÇÇ, its short-term impact is far greater. Since pre-industrial times, atmospheric methane has risen by about 150%, well beyond natural levels seen over the past 650,000 years. This surge is accelerating global warming and making climate targets harder to reach. Cutting methane emissions is one of the fastest ways to slow near-term climate change.",

It also occurs naturally through microbial activity in soils and oceans. Although present in smaller quantities than carbon dioxide or methane, nitrous oxide is the third most significant heat-trapping gas in Earth's atmosphere. It has a global warming potential approximately 265 times that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period and remains in the atmosphere for about 114 years. Beyond its role in climate change, nitrous oxide is currently the leading ozone-depleting substance emitted by human activities, surpassing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in its impact on the stratospheric ozone layer.",

Since the late 20th century, Arctic sea ice has declined dramatically, with losses accelerating from around 2‚Äì3% in the 1980s to over 12% per decade since 2010. Another major concern is permafrost thawing. As frozen ground warms, it releases methane‚Äîa potent greenhouse gas‚Äîinto the atmosphere, further amplifying global warming. These changes not only impact Arctic ecosystems but also influence weather patterns and climate systems worldwide.",
